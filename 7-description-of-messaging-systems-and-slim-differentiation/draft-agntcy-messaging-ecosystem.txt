 An Overview of Messaging Systems and Their Applicability to Agentic AI
                draft-agntcy-messaging-ecosystem-latest

Abstract

   When designing a multi-agent system for generative AI, the messaging
   layer becomes a critical piece of infrastructure.  GenAI agents—built
   with frameworks like LangGraph, AutoGen, or LlamaIndex—often need to
   collaborate in real time, exchange high volumes of streaming data
   (e.g., token-by-token outputs), and coordinate complex tasks such as
   voting or consensus.  Moreover, security requirements extend well
   beyond basic TLS; in scenarios where agents share sensitive models or
   partial computations, post-compromise security and robust end-to-end
   encryption are essential.

   In practice, you’ll want a protocol that efficiently handles one-to-
   many or many-to-many communication, supports dynamic membership (with
   agents joining or leaving on the fly), and scales to accommodate a
   “forest” of agents spread across global networks.  Some protocols
   excel at ultra-low-latency, high-throughput streaming—critical for
   continuous token streams or aggregated embeddings—while others
   emphasize strong consistency and durability.  Additionally, advanced
   cryptographic features such as automatic key rotation and forward
   secrecy are vital when compromised credentials must not enable an
   attacker to decrypt future communications.

   Below, we compare six popular messaging protocols—AMQP, MQTT, NATS,
   AMQP over WebSockets, Kafka, and the emerging AGNTCY SLIM (Secure
   Low-Latency Interactive Messaging )—across dimensions that matter for
   GenAI agent systems: streaming performance, delivery guarantees,
   flexible pub/sub patterns, agent coordination, security (including
   end-to-end encryption and zero-trust support), and real-world
   adoption.
