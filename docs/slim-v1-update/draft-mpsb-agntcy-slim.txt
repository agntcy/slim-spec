2.  Introduction

2.1.  Summary

   The Secure Low-Latency Interactive Messaging (SLIM) protocol
   addresses the unique communication requirements of modern AI agentic
   applications by providing a secure, scalable, and efficient messaging
   infrastructure.  SLIM combines the reliability and performance of
   gRPC with publish-subscribe messaging capabilities, creating a
   comprehensive solution for interactive AI application communication.

   At its core, SLIM consists of three primary components: messaging
   nodes that serve as intelligent message queues, message producers
   that publish encrypted content, and message consumers that subscribe
   to and receive messages.  The protocol leverages Message Layer
   Security (MLS) for end-to-end encryption, ensuring that messages
   remain confidential even when passing through intermediate nodes or
   experiencing TLS termination along the communication path.

   The architecture is built around a distributed network of messaging
   nodes, each maintaining connection and subscription tables to enable
   efficient message routing.  A centralized control plane orchestrates
   the entire system, handling node discovery, configuration management,
   security policies, and system monitoring.  This separation of control
   and data planes allows for scalable deployment while maintaining
   centralized administrative control.

   SLIM employs a hierarchical naming system based on Decentralized
   Identifiers (DIDs) to ensure globally unique, secure, and routable
   channel names.  This naming scheme supports both decentralized and
   federated authentication models, enabling flexible deployment across
   different organizational boundaries while maintaining security and
   interoperability.

   The protocol includes a session layer that abstracts the complexity
   of MLS operations and messaging infrastructure from applications,
   providing simple publish-subscribe APIs and native Remote Procedure
   Call (RPC) semantics via SRPC (SLIM RPC).  SRPC enables request/
   response and streaming RPC directly over SLIM's secure messaging
   fabric (see [SRPC]), while handling authentication, encryption,
   connection management, and fault recovery automatically.  This design
   enables developers to focus on application logic rather than the
   underlying messaging complexities.

   Security is fundamental to SLIM's design, with authentication and
   authorization handled through MLS groups, cryptographic client
   identities, and configurable access policies.  The protocol supports
   deployment in various environments, from data center workloads and
   mobile applications, while maintaining consistent security guarantees
   and low-latency performance characteristics.

3.  Protocol Overview

   SLIM is designed to work as a messaging layer for applications
   running as workloads in a data center, but also running in a browser
   or mobile device while guaranteeing end-to-end security and low-
   latency communication.  SLIM leverages HTTP/2 end to end as a thin
   waist of the communication stack and avoids the need to create
   message transcoding along the path.  By leveraging message encryption
   via MLS [RFC9420] [RFC9750], TLS connection termination along the
   path does not negatively affect confidentiality.  Authentication and
   authorization are handled at the application level and can be managed
   in a decentralized or federated way or a mix of both.

   In SLIM there are three main communication elements: intermediate
   nodes equipped with message queues, message producers and message
   consumers.

   A producer (also called a "publisher") is an endpoint that
   encapsulates content in SLIM messages for transport within the SLIM
   message network of nodes.  A producer MUST belong to an MLS group to
   encrypt messages that can be decrypted by message consumers who are
   members of the same group, as specified by the MLS protocol.  Once a
   SLIM message is encrypted, it can be published under a routable name,
   which is human-readable and hierarchical.  This routable channel name
   is used by intermediate nodes to store and forward messages within
   the same channel, allowing consumers to retrieve messages using this
   name.

   A routable name is a name prefix that is stored in a forwarding table
   (FIB).  This enables requests to reach the producer and fetch a
   response, if one exists.

   Secure group members are clients as described in [RFC9750] which can
   write messages as producers or read messages as consumers.  Most of
   the time, clients are able to read and write messages in the same
   secure group.  Clients join secure groups as described in the MLS
   standard [RFC9750] via an authentication service and by exchanging
   messages via the delivery service.  In the SLIM architecture, the
   SLIM nodes constitute the infrastructure that is responsible for
   delivering messages in a secure group via a logical SLIM channel.
   MLS commit messages are exchanged directly using the SLIM messaging
   nodes.

3.1.  Messaging Nodes

   Messaging nodes are fundamental components of the SLIM architecture
   that serve as specialized message queues.  They fulfill several
   critical functions in the messaging infrastructure.  At their core,
   nodes efficiently route messages between connected clients using
   intelligent routing algorithms while handling the distribution and
   delivery of messages across the network infrastructure.

              Figure 2: SLIM messaging node network topology.

   The node architecture relies on two essential data structures that
   work in concert.  The connection table forms the foundation for
   tracking all active client connections and their states, maintaining
   crucial metadata about each connected client.  Alongside it, the
   subscription table manages topic subscriptions and implements message
   filtering rules, determining which messages should be delivered to
   which clients.

   Through this dual-table architecture, messaging nodes can effectively
   coordinate message delivery while maintaining optimal system
   performance.  The connection and subscription mechanisms work
   together seamlessly to ensure reliable message routing, proper client
   tracking, and efficient subscription management across the
   distributed system.  Each node operates autonomously while
   participating in the broader network, creating a resilient and
   scalable messaging infrastructure.

3.1.1.  Connection Table

   The connection table serves as a fundamental data structure within
   the SLIM messaging node architecture, maintaining a comprehensive
   registry of both client-to-node and node-to-node connections.  Each
   entry in the table contains essential metadata about connected
   endpoints, including their unique identifiers, connection timestamps,
   authentication status, and current state information.

   For client connections, the table tracks end-user applications that
   connect to receive or send messages through the system.  For node
   connections, it maintains the network fabric topology by recording
   inter-node relationships and routing paths.  This dual-purpose nature
   enables SLIM to manage both the edge connectivity with clients and
   the internal communication infrastructure between nodes.

   Connection states are dynamically tracked and updated to reflect the
   real-time status of each endpoint.  This includes monitoring whether
   clients or nodes are actively connected, temporarily disconnected, or
   in various intermediate states.  The table maintains crucial session
   information such as endpoint capabilities, protocol versions, and
   quality of service parameters that influence message handling.

   By maintaining this detailed connection state, the table enables
   efficient routing decisions across the entire network fabric.  It
   provides each messaging node with immediate access to both client and
   node status information, allowing for rapid determination of message
   delivery paths and handling of connection-related events.  The
   connection table also plays a vital role in system reliability by
   tracking connection health and enabling quick detection of
   disconnections or network issues at both the client and node levels.

   A connection table maps location-independent channel names to
   connections to remote nodes.  The mapping is used to forward messages
   towards nodes that can either route messages or consume them in case
   consumers are directly connected to the node.

   Channel names are encoded as human-readable hierarchical names for
   efficient table lookup operations.

3.1.1.1.  Subscription Table and Matching

   The subscription table is used to map channel subscriptions to
   neighboring nodes.  It manages the distribution of messages based on
   subscriptions and ensures efficient delivery of messages.  A message
   carries the data to be delivered as well as the channel name and the
   address locator of the message producer.

   The control plane manages the configuration and updates of the
   connection and subscription tables.

   |                |                  |         data ... }      |
   +-------------------------------------------------------------+

                             locator, and data.

3.1.2.  Control Plane

   The control plane is responsible for the management and orchestration
   of SLIM messaging nodes and their interconnections.  It handles the
   configuration, provisioning, and monitoring of nodes, ensuring that
   the messaging infrastructure operates smoothly and efficiently.

   Key functions of the control plane include:

   *  *Node Discovery and Registration*: New messaging nodes discover
      each other and register their presence with the control plane.
      This enables the control plane to maintain an up-to-date view of
      the messaging infrastructure.

   *  *Configuration Management*: The control plane distributes
      configuration updates to messaging nodes, including connection and
      subscription table updates.  This ensures consistent and correct
      routing behavior across the node network.

   *  *Monitoring and Analytics*: The control plane collects and
      analyzes telemetry data from messaging nodes, providing insights
      into system performance, message flow, and potential issues.

   *  *Security and Access Control*: The control plane manages security
      policies, authentication, and authorization of nodes and clients,
      ensuring a secure messaging environment.

   By centralizing these management functions, the control plane
   enhances the overall reliability, security, and performance of the
   SLIM messaging infrastructure.  It enables efficient scaling, dynamic
   reconfiguration, and proactive maintenance of the node network.

3.1.3.  Session Layer

   The session layer serves as a critical abstraction component that
   bridges application frameworks with the underlying SLIM messaging
   infrastructure.  It provides a unified interface that simplifies the
   complexity of secure messaging while handling the details of MLS
   client operations and message distribution.

3.1.3.1.  Core Responsibilities

   The session layer encapsulates several key functionalities:

   *MLS Client Operations*: The layer implements comprehensive MLS
   client functionality including authentication procedures, message
   encryption and decryption, key management, and group membership
   operations.  It handles the complex cryptographic operations
   transparently from the application perspective.

   *Channel Management*: It provides seamless channel subscription and
   unsubscription capabilities, managing the lifecycle of channel
   memberships and maintaining subscription state across connection
   interruptions or node failures.

   *Message Abstraction*: The session layer abstracts message passing
   between applications and the SLIM message distribution network,
   handling message formatting, routing, and delivery confirmation while
   providing simple send and receive primitives to applications.

   *Configuration Abstraction*: It eliminates the need for applications
   to manage complex configuration details required to connect to SLIM
   nodes, automatically handling node discovery, connection
   establishment, and subscription management.

3.1.3.2.  API Design Principles

   The session layer API is designed with the following principles:

   *  Simplicity: Applications interact with the messaging system
      through intuitive publish/subscribe operations without needing to
      understand the underlying MLS or routing complexities.

   *  Asynchronous Operations: All messaging operations are designed to
      be non-blocking, supporting high-performance applications.

   *  Framework Agnostic: The API provides language bindings and
      framework adapters for various application development
      environments, ensuring broad compatibility across different
      technology stacks.

   *  Error Handling: Comprehensive error reporting and recovery
      mechanisms help applications handle communication issues and
      authentication failures.

3.1.3.3.  Session Management

   The session layer maintains persistent session state at the client
   across network disconnections and node failures.  It implements
   automatic reconnection logic, subscription recovery, and message
   queuing to ensure reliable message delivery even in unstable network
   conditions.  Session persistence includes maintaining MLS group
   membership state, channel subscriptions, and pending message queues.

3.2.  Naming Considerations

   SLIM requires several types of identifiers: node names, channel
   names, and client locators.

   Node names are used for secure onboarding and authentication.  Node
   names do not have aggregation requirements and therefore use
   decentralized identifiers:

   node name A: did:key(node_A)

   A channel name identifies a messaging group and must be routable;
   that is, it must include a globally unique network prefix that can be
   aggregated for scalable lookups and message forwarding.

   A group in SLIM is an MLS group with a moderator client responsible
   for adding and removing group members.  The moderator is identified
   by a cryptographic public key as defined in MLS [RFC9750], and in
   SLIM, also by a decentralized identifier derived as the hash of the
   public key [DID-W3C].

   By naming entities with hashes [RFC6920], SLIM achieves secure and
   globally unique naming, enabling the creation of permissionless
   systems where channel names and client names can be distributed
   across administrative boundaries.  W3C DIDs are optional but can be
   used when hash links are employed and conform to the Named
   Information [RFC6920] standard, referencing the IANA registry
   [NI-Registry].

   SLIM routable name prefixes and client names can use different DID
   methods which have different resolution systems such as did:web
   [DID-Web], did:key [DID-Key] or did:plc [DID-ATProto].  See
   [DID-Methods] for well-known DID methods.

   The naming structure follows these patterns:

   client locator: did:key(org)/namespace(org)/service/did:key(client)
   channel name: did:key(org)/namespace(org)/service/did:key(moderator)

   Where the moderator is the special client that has the role to create
   a channel, add actual application clients and remove them from the
   group.  As mentioned above the moderator is a data plane client which
   is a decentralized instance of the MLS delivery service as described
   in [RFC9420].

   The hierarchical structure is required to maximize aggregation in
   subscription tables, which can aggregate multiple names under name
   prefixes such as organization identifiers, organization namespaces,
   and services.

3.3.  Deployment Considerations

   SLIM helps the deployment of agentic AI applications where a
   combination of data streams, tools and LLMs are combined to create a
   distributed multi-agent systems that can solve problems via AI.

   These applications work as SLIM clients and MAY expose a service to
   the secure group.  The channel and client naming structure combined
   allows for service discovery capabilities by binding the application
   a specific application namespace and service name.

4.  RPC in Agentic Protocols and Relationship to Messaging

   Most agent-facing interfaces in use today—such as A2A and the Model
   Context Protocol (MCP)—are Remote Procedure Call (RPC) oriented.
   They expose synchronous request/response semantics for tool
   invocation, resource listing, and capability execution.  This section
   clarifies how RPC relates to asynchronous messaging and how the two
   paradigms interoperate in agentic systems.

4.1.  RPC vs. Messaging: Synchronous vs. Asynchronous

   *  *RPC (A2A, MCP)*: The caller issues a request and blocks or awaits
      a timely response.  Semantics emphasize tightly scoped operations
      (for example, “call tool X with parameters Y”) with bounded
      latency and explicit error contracts.

   *  *Messaging (AMQP, MQTT, NATS, Kafka, SLIM)*: Decoupled producers
      and consumers communicate via topics, subjects, or queues.
      Delivery can be one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many, with
      loose coupling, buffering, and retries.  Producers are not
      inherently blocked by consumers.

   In practice, agentic applications need both: synchronous tool
   invocations for interactivity and asynchronous channels for streaming
   output, progress, coordination, and fan-out/fan-in patterns.

4.2.  Challenges of RPC over Messaging

   Bridging synchronous RPC semantics with asynchronous messaging
   infrastructure introduces several challenges:

   *  *Request/Response Correlation*: Messaging systems are inherently
      decoupled and do not guarantee a direct response path.
      Implementing RPC requires correlating requests and responses,
      often using unique identifiers and temporary reply channels.

   *  *Latency and Ordering*: Messaging layers may introduce variable
      delivery latency and do not guarantee strict ordering, which can
      complicate synchronous RPC expectations.

   *  *Error Handling*: Messaging systems may buffer, retry, or drop
      messages, making it difficult to propagate errors and timeouts in
      a way that matches RPC contracts.

   *  *Streaming and Multiplexing*: Supporting streaming RPC (e.g.,
      bidirectional or server/client streaming) over messaging requires
      careful management of stream lifecycles, backpressure, and
      multiplexing multiple logical RPCs over shared channels.

   *  *Security and Authorization*: Ensuring that only authorized
      parties can invoke or respond to RPCs, and that all messages are
      authenticated and encrypted, is more complex in a distributed,
      group-based messaging environment.

   The SRPC capability in SLIM addresses these challenges by providing a
   native, secure, and streaming RPC abstraction directly over the SLIM
   messaging layer, as described in the following section.

4.3.  Remote Procedure Calls over SLIM (SRPC)

   SLIM natively supports Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) through its SRPC
   (SLIM RPC) capability, enabling efficient, secure, and flexible
   communication patterns for distributed and agentic applications.
   SRPC is designed to provide gRPC-like streaming RPC semantics
   directly over the SLIM transport, leveraging SLIM's secure,
   multiplexed, and group-oriented messaging infrastructure.

4.3.1.  Overview

   SRPC allows applications to define and invoke remote procedures using
   familiar gRPC patterns, including unary calls, client streaming,
   server streaming, and bidirectional streaming.  This enables
   developers to build complex, stateful, and interactive workflows
   between distributed agents, services, and tools, all while benefiting
   from SLIM's end-to-end security and group membership features.

4.3.2.  Key Features

   *  *Streaming RPC Support*: SRPC supports all gRPC streaming modes,
      allowing for flexible data exchange patterns such as real-time
      data feeds, interactive sessions, and collaborative workflows.

   *  *Multiplexed Transport*: Multiple concurrent RPC streams can be
      established over a single SLIM connection, reducing overhead and
      improving resource efficiency.

   *  *Secure Group Communication*: SRPC leverages SLIM's MLS-based
      security model, ensuring that all RPC calls and responses are
      encrypted and authenticated within the context of secure groups.

   *  *Protocol Buffers Integration*: Service definitions and message
      schemas are specified using Protocol Buffers, enabling strong
      typing and interoperability across languages and platforms.

4.3.3.  Architecture

   SRPC is implemented as a protocol extension and a set of client/
   server libraries that integrate with the SLIM session layer.
   Developers define service interfaces using Protocol Buffers, and code
   generation tools produce client and server stubs that handle message
   serialization, stream management, and invocation logic over SLIM
   channels.

   The SRPC protocol manages the lifecycle of RPC streams, including
   initiation, message exchange, error handling, and stream termination.
   It ensures that all communication adheres to SLIM's security and
   routing policies, and that group membership and authorization are
   enforced for each RPC interaction.

4.3.4.  Benefits for Agentic Applications

   By providing native, streaming RPC capabilities, SRPC enables agentic
   AI applications and distributed systems to:

   *  Orchestrate complex, multi-step workflows across multiple agents
      and services.

   *  Exchange large or continuous data streams efficiently and
      securely.

   *  Implement interactive, real-time collaboration between distributed
      components.

   *  Simplify integration with existing gRPC-based tools and
      ecosystems.

   SRPC makes it possible to build robust, scalable, and secure agentic
   applications that fully leverage the power of SLIM's messaging and
   group communication model.

4.3.5.  SLIM Naming in SRPC

   SRPC derives per-service and per-handler routing names directly from
   the structured SLIM naming scheme to enable efficient subscription
   and message dispatch without requiring application developers to
   manually manage channel names.

   Each application participating in a secure SLIM group already has a
   hierarchical SLIM name composed of multiple components (organization
   identifier, namespace, service, and client/moderator key).  SRPC
   appends a handler-qualified suffix to the service component to form
   unique, routable identifiers for RPC methods.

   Service interface definitions (e.g., Protocol Buffers) describe one
   or more RPC handlers supporting the four common gRPC communication
   patterns:

   *  Unary → Unary

   *  Unary → Stream

   *  Stream → Unary

   *  Stream → Stream (bidirectional)

   For every handler declared inside a service, SRPC generates a method
   routing token using the pattern:

   {package}.{service}-{handler}

   Example: Given a protobuf package example_service and service Test
   with handlers ExampleUnaryUnary, ExampleUnaryStream,
   ExampleStreamUnary, ExampleStreamStream, the generated handler tokens
   are:

   *  example_service.Test-ExampleUnaryUnary

   *  example_service.Test-ExampleUnaryStream

   *  example_service.Test-ExampleStreamUnary

   *  example_service.Test-ExampleStreamStream

   SRPC then embeds the handler token into the second component (service
   segment) of the full SLIM name for routing.  If the original SLIM
   application name components c[i] are:

   c[0]/c[1]/c[2]/c[3]

   The subscribed name for a specific handler becomes:

   c[0]/c[1]/c[2]-example_service.Test-ExampleUnaryUnary/c[3]

   This transformation yields a distinct, hierarchical, and aggregatable
   name per RPC method while preserving the organizational and namespace
   prefix structure needed for subscription table aggregation.
   Applications exposing SRPC services automatically subscribe to all
   derived handler names; the SRPC library manages these subscriptions
   and maps incoming messages to the corresponding generated server stub
   functions.  Developers implement only the handler logic exactly as
   with conventional gRPC, without manual SLIM channel management.

   Benefits of this naming approach: - Deterministic and collision-
   resistant per-method naming. - Preserves hierarchical aggregation for
   routing efficiency. - Avoids separate discovery round-trips for
   method endpoints. - Enables capability advertisement to reference
   method names directly. - Simplifies multi-service deployments—adding
   a new handler produces a single new routable token.

   This integration of SRPC handler naming with SLIM's hierarchical
   naming model ensures consistent, secure, and scalable routing
   semantics for RPC traffic within agentic groups.
