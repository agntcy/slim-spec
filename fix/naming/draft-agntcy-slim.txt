                        draft-agntcy-agp-latest

Abstract

   This document specifies the Agent Gateway Protocol (AGP), a protocol
   designed to support real-time interactive AI applications at scale.
   AGP extends gRPC with publish-subscribe capabilities to enable
   efficient many-to-many communication patterns between AI agents.  The
   protocol provides mechanisms for connection management, stream
   multiplexing, and flow control while maintaining compatibility with
   existing gRPC deployments.

2.  Introduction

   As AI systems become more sophisticated and interconnected, there is
   a growing need for protocols that can support real-time interactive
   applications at scale.  The Agent Gateway Protocol (AGP) addresses
   this need by:

   *  Extending gRPC with publish-subscribe patterns

   *  Supporting bidirectional streaming between agents

   *  Enabling efficient many-to-many communication

   *  Maintaining backward compatibility with gRPC

2.1.  Protocol Overview

   AGP builds on gRPC's core features while adding:

   *  Native support for pub/sub messaging patterns

   *  Enhanced stream multiplexing capabilities

   *  Real-time event notification system

   *  Dynamic topic creation and management

3.2.  Core Components

   *  Gateway Nodes: Handle routing and message distribution

   *  Topics: Named channels for pub/sub communication

   *  Streams: Bidirectional communication channels

   *  Services: Application-specific RPC definitions

3.2.1.  Gateway Nodes

   Gateway Nodes are essential components of the Agent Gateway Protocol
   (AGP) architecture.  They handle routing and message distribution
   between agents and manage the communication infrastructure.  Gateway
   Nodes are composed of two main tables: the connection table and the
   subscription table.

3.2.1.1.  Connection Table

   The connection table maintains interfaces with neighboring nodes and
   local applications.  It is responsible for:

   *  Establishing and managing connections with other Gateway Nodes

   *  Maintaining active connections with local applications

   *  Handling connection setup, teardown, and error recovery

   The connection table entries include:

   *  Node ID: Unique identifier for the neighboring node or local
      application

   *  Connection Status: Current status of the connection (e.g., active,
      inactive, error)

   *  Connection Parameters: Details such as IP address, port, and
      security credentials

3.2.1.2.  Subscription Table

   The subscription table is used to map topic subscriptions to
   neighboring nodes.  It manages the distribution of messages based on
   topic subscriptions and ensures efficient routing of pub/sub
   messages.  The subscription table entries include:

   *  Topic: The name of the topic to which the subscription applies

   *  Subscriber Node IDs: List of node IDs that have subscribed to the
      topic

   *  Subscription Status: Current status of the subscription (e.g.,
      active, inactive)

   The subscription table is responsible for:

   *  Managing topic subscriptions from local applications and
      neighboring nodes

   *  Routing messages to the appropriate subscribers based on topic
      subscriptions

   *  Handling subscription updates, additions, and removals

   *  Ensuring efficient and reliable message delivery

   By maintaining these tables, Gateway Nodes facilitate seamless
   communication and message distribution in the AGP network, enabling
   real-time interactive AI applications at scale.

4.  Security Considerations

   The Agent Gateway Protocol (AGP) relies on the Messaging Layer
   Security (MLS) protocol to provide end-to-end security for group
   communications between agents.

4.1.  MLS Integration

   AGP uses MLS for the following security properties:

   *  End-to-end encryption for all agent communications

   *  Forward secrecy and post-compromise security

   *  Group key management and membership changes

   *  Scalable group messaging security

4.2.  Authentication and Identity

   Each agent MUST:

   *  Maintain cryptographic identities compatible with MLS

   *  Use certified credentials for initial authentication

   *  Validate peer credentials during connection establishment

   *  Support credential revocation and rotation

4.3.  Group Security

   MLS provides the following guarantees for agent groups:

   *  Continuous group key updates

   *  Secure member addition and removal

   *  Protection against message forgery

   *  Perfect forward secrecy for all messages

4.4.  Operational Security

   Implementations MUST:

   *  Maintain secure key storage

   *  Support MLS epoch advancement

   *  Implement proper credential management

   *  Monitor for security events

   *  Support secure group state recovery

4.5.  Privacy Considerations

   AGP with MLS provides:

   *  Metadata protection

   *  Group membership privacy

   *  Participant anonymity options

   *  Traffic analysis resistance

4.6.  Implementation Requirements

   Implementations MUST NOT:

   *  Use non-MLS encryption schemes

   *  Support downgrades to less secure modes

   *  Allow plaintext communication

   *  Skip credential verification
